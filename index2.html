    <h1>What Is Front-End Development?</h1>
    <p>Front-end development involves the “client-facing” side of web development. That is to say usually, front-end web development refers to the portion of the site, app, or</p>
    <p>digital product that users will see and interact with. A Front-End Developer, therefore, is responsible for the way a digital product looks and “feels,” which is why</p>
    <p>they are often also referred to as Web Designers.</p>
    <p>Front-End Web Developers focus on translating website design and visual ideas into code. A front-end Software Developer takes the design ideas created by others on web</p>
    <p>development teams and programs them into reality, acting as a bridge between design and technology.</p>
    <h1>Front-End Development Jobs</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Front-End Developer</li>
        <li>Front-End Engineer</li>
        <li>Mobile Front-End Web Developer</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>What Is Back-End Development?</h1>
    <p>If Front-End Developers are responsible for how a digital product looks, Back-End Developers are focused on how it works. A Back-End Developer creates the basic</p>
    <p>framework of a website before maintaining it and ensuring it performs the way it should, including database interactions, user authentication, server, network and</p>
    <p>hosting configuration, and business logic. Working behind the scenes or server-side Back End Developers are concerned with the systems and structures that allow computer applications to perform as desired.</p>
    <h1>What Is a Full-Stack Developer?</h1>
    <p>A Full-Stack Developer is someone familiar with both front- and back-end development. Full Stack Developers usually understand a wide variety of</p>
    <p>programming languages and because of their versatility, they might be given more of a leadership role on projects than developers who specialize. They are generalists,</p>
    <p>adept at wearing both hats, and familiar with every layer of development. Obviously, employers want to hire Full-Stack Developers according to an Indeed study, they</p>
    <p>are the fourth-most in-demand job in tech.</p>
